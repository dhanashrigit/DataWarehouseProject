Design and Development of Data Warehouse for Analysis of Supermarket Data using BI Tools

# Introduction
This study represents the design and development of data warehouse for supermarket data. 
The analysis provides the sales and profit generated by the supermarket based on the data such as product,
customer and time. In this paper, analysis of profit generated with the sales is provided along with various
structures to support the reasoning. Dataset of customer contains considerable information from various cities of Canada.
Different products based on their shelf life and stock available is considered. The data is modelled in different dimensions. 
The data needs to be cleaned before applying to the analysis tools. 
This paper uses Pentaho for analysis and results are generated by modifying the mdx queries using different charts available. 
Such a model is necessary for making key decisions and strategic planning for a supermarket. 
The results provide with the representation of data with respect to four measures considered, namely, 
actual and original sales, profit and discount with respect to various dimensions.
